    <h1 class="title">Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese</h1>
    <img class="picture" src="https://thecozycook.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Buffalo-Chicken-Mac-and-Cheese.jpg">
    <h2> <em> Classic comfort food dish with a twist. </em> </h2>
    <p> Packed with protein, this dish takes two of my favorite things and makes them
        into a healthy-ish version to enjoy. Made without that big brick of processed cheese,
        you would never know this is made with cottage cheese and protein pasta.</p>
